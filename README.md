# NP Art Center VR Interactive Tour
## Project Description
This is an immersive Virtual Reality tour designed for the Meta Quest 2 headset. This application allows users to explore given 360-degree environments, transition between different rooms, and interact with points of interest. Some rooms features an introductory voice narration, and interactive buttons offer additional, context-specific audio information.

## Features
 - Immersive 360Â° rooms: Explore various rooms rendered from 360-degree panoramic images and videos.
 - Room Transitions: Move in different rooms with comfortable fade in/out effect
 - Voice Narration:
   - Interactive voice narration for specific artifacts or points of interest, triggered by UI buttons.

   - Text-to-Speech (TTS) powered by Meta XR Voice SDK (Wit.ai integration).
   - Intuitive VR Interaction: Uses Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit for controller-based (raycast) interaction with UI elements.
   - Optimized for Meta Quest 2
